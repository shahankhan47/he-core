                    "Question": "Specifying coding conventions",
                    "Answer" :  "The easiest way to do that with aider is to simply create a small markdown file and include it in the chat.\nFor example, say we want our python code to:\n- Prefer httpx over requests for making http requests.\n- Use types everywhere possible.\nWe would simply create a file like CONVENTIONS.md with those lines and then we can add it to the aider chat, along with the file(s) that we want to edit.\nIt’s best to load the conventions file with /read CONVENTIONS.md or aider --read CONVENTIONS.md. This way it is marked as read-only, and cached if prompt caching is enabled.\nCommunity contributed conventions\nYou can check the aider conventions repository to find or contribute conventions files.\nAlways load conventions\nYou can also configure aider to always load your conventions file in the .aider.conf.yml config file:\n# alone\nread: CONVENTIONS.md\n# multiple files\nread: [CONVENTIONS.md, anotherfile.txt]\nExample\nSee below for an example of how the conventions can affect the code that aider writes.\n$ aider –read CONVENTIONS.md useragent.py\nAider v0.24.2-dev\nAdded CONVENTIONS.md to the chat.\nAdded useragent.py to the chat.\nwrite a function that uses httpbin to check the user agent on the request. return the ua.\nTo fulfill your request, I will:\nAdd an import for httpx.\nWrite a function named check_user_agent that makes a GET request to httpbin.org/user-agent and returns the user agent string.\nHere is the diff for the useragent.py file:\n--- useragent.py\n+++ useragent.py\n@@ ... @@\n+import httpx\n+\n+def check_user_agent() -> str:\n+    response = httpx.get('https://httpbin.org/user-agent')\n+    return response.json()['user-agent']\nThis function uses httpx to make a GET request to httpbin.org/user-agent, which returns a JSON response containing the user agent of the HTTP client. The function then extracts the user agent string from the JSON response and returns it.\nApplied edit to useragent.py\nGPT correctly used httpx and provided type hints. See below for the transcript of this same coding task conducted without using CONVENTIONS.md. In this case, GPT used requests and skipped types, which is perhaps more typical in small python scripts.\n$ aider useragent.py\nAider v0.24.2-dev\nAdded useragent.py to the chat.\nwrite a function that uses httpbin to check the user agent on the request. return the ua.\n--- /dev/null\n+++ useragent.py\n@@ ... @@\n+import requests\n+\n+def check_user_agent():\n+    response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/user-agent')\n+    user_agent = response.json().get('user-agent')\n+    return user_agent\n\nApplied edit to useragent.py"

                    "Question": "How are notifications Handled",
                    "Answer" :  "Aider can notify you when it’s done working and is waiting for your input. This is especially useful for long-running operations or when you’re multitasking. Usage Enable notifications with the --notifications flag: aider --notifications When enabled, aider will notify you when the LLM has finished generating a response and is waiting for your input. OS-Specific Notifications Aider automatically detects your operating system and uses an appropriate notification method: macOS: Uses terminal-notifier if available, falling back to AppleScript notifications Linux: Uses notify-send or zenity if available Windows: Uses PowerShell to display a message box Custom Notification Commands You can specify a custom notification command with --notifications-command: aider --notifications-command  your-custom-command For example, on macOS you might use: aider --notifications-command say 'Aider is ready' Remote Notifications For remote notifications you could use Apprise, which is a cross-platform Python library for sending notifications to various services. We can use Apprise to send notifications to Slack aider --notifications-command apprise -b 'Aider is ready' 'slack://your-slack-webhook-token' or Discord aider --notifications-command apprise -b 'Aider is ready' 'discord://your-discord-webhook-token' or even to your phone via Pushbullet aider --notifications-command apprise -b 'Aider is ready' 'pbul://your-pushbullet-access-token' Check more how to use and configure Apprise on their GitHub page. Configuration You can add these settings to your configuration file: # Enable notifications notifications: true # Optional custom notification command notifications_command: your-custom-command Or in your .env file: AIDER_NOTIFICATIONS=true AIDER_NOTIFICATIONS_COMMAND=your-custom-command"

                    "Question": "Voice-to-code with aider",
                    "Answer" :  "Speak with aider about your code! Request new features, test cases or bug fixes using your voice and let aider do the work of editing the files in your local git repo. As with all of aider’s capabilities, you can use voice-to-code with an existing repo or to start a new project. Voice support fits quite naturally into aider’s AI pair programming chat interface. Now you can fluidly switch between voice and text chat when you ask aider to edit your code. How to use voice-to-code Use the in-chat /voice command to start recording, and press ENTER when you’re done speaking. Your voice coding instructions will be transcribed, as if you had typed them into the aider chat session. See the installation instructions for information on how to enable the /voice command. Aider v0.11.2-dev Added app.py to the chat. /voice Recording, press ENTER when done... 8.6sec ‘ add a factorial endpoint that uses math factorial ’ Add a factorial endpoint that uses math.factorial. To add a factorial endpoint to the Flask application, we need to modify the app.py file. Here are the steps: Add a new route /fact/int:x to the Flask application. In the function for this route, call math.factorial(x) and return the result as a string. Here is the edit block for these changes: app.py <<<<<<< HEAD if name == 'main': print('Starting...') app.run() ======= @app.route('/fact/int:x') def factorial(x): result = math.factorial(x) return str(result) if name == 'main': print('Starting...') app.run() >>>>>>> updated Applied edit to app.py Commit ef9e3e7 aider: Add a factorial endpoint that uses math.factorial."
